        Class:

        1.A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects. It defines the structure
        and behavior (methods) that the objects of the class will have.

        2.Every program starts with a class, which is user-defined. It serves as the
         fundamental building block of object-oriented programming (OOP).

        3.A class contains data members (fields or attributes) and methods (functions)
         that define the behavior of the class.

        Objects:

        4.Objects are instances of a class, meaning they represent a specific realization of the class.

        5.Objects are created from a class using the new keyword and have a reference data type.
        This reference points to the memory location where the object is stored.

        6.Using objects, we can access and invoke the methods and fields defined within the class.

        For example create a object for Test class ?

        Test Ref_Variable = new Test();

        1. 'Test' is a class
        2. 'Ref_Variable' reference variable
        3. 'new' is a keyword to create a new object
        4. 'Test()' is an instance of class (Object)
        5. 'Test' is the reference data type because it defines
        the type of the object that the variable 'Ref_Variable' can refer to.
